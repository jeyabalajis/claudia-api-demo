# Claudia API demo

Claudia API Builder makes it possible to use AWS API Gateway as if it were a lightweight JavaScript web server, so it helps developers get started easily and reduces the learning curve required to launch web APIs in AWS.

This demo shows how easy it is to launch an API with API Gateway in the front and AWS Lambda as a microservice, **in under five minutes.**

## Installation
npm install

## Deployment

1. Review the start script under package.json and modify the name of the AWS project and profile (which holds AWS credentials)
2. Run the following command

`npm run start`
